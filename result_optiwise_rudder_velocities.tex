The rudder inflow angle $\gamma$ and velocity $V_R$ were investigated by conducting a set of separate VCT calculations where the rudder was removed, so that an undisturbed flow by the rudder could be observed. The longitudinal and transverse inflow velocities $u_R$ and $v_R$ were measured along the rudder stock from the root to the tip of the rudder. \autoref{fig:rudder_velocities_span} shows the inflow velocity $\gamma=atan(v_R/u_R)$ along the rudder stock during two circle tests.
