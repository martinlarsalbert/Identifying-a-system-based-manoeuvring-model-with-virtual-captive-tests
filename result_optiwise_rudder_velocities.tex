The rudder inflow angle $\gamma$ and velocity $V_R$ were investigated by conducting a set of separate VCT calculations where the rudder was removed, so that an undisturbed flow by the rudder could be observed. The longitudinal and transverse inflow velocities $u_R$ and $v_R$ were measured along the rudder stock from the root to the tip of the rudder. \autoref{fig:inflow_angle_straight} shows the inflow velocity $\gamma=atan(v_R/u_R)$ along the rudder stock when ship is on a straight course. The inflow angle varies a lot along the rudder span. The average value along the rudder span is howver close to zero, showed by the dashed vertical line.

Rudder forces have been calculated with the MMG rudder model, where the expressions to calculate $u_R$ and $v_R$ have been replaced by measured values, represented by the average values along the rudder span. \autoref{fig:inflow_to_rudder_force} shows results from these calculations. The total velocity at the rudder $V_R$ does not vary that much during the drift angle and circle tests, as seen in \autoref{fig:inflow_to_force_drift_angle} and \autoref{fig:inflow_to_force_circle}. The inflow angle $\gamma$ varies between about -5 and 5 degrees during the drift angle and circle tests, so that 10 degrees drift angle corresponds to 5 degrees inflow angle, as a result of the flow straightening effect of the hull. The side force is well predicted for -10 and 10 degrees drift angle. For the straight ahead condition, with zero drift angle, the force is under predicted compared to the VCT results. The side force predicted by the MMG model agrees well with the VCT results for positive yaw rates, but not the negative yaw rates, as shown in \autoref{fig:inflow_to_force_circle}. The average inflow angles and speeds are of about the same magnitude for the \textpm 0.07 rad/s yaw rates, yet the VCT rudder side force differs, with -3.9 N compared to 3.3 N.
