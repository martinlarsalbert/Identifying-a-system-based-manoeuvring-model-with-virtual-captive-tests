\noindent In order to further investigate the impact of asymmetric flow due to drifting on the modeling of rudder forces, and possible modification of semi-empirical rudder model used for wPCC, both port and starboard maneuvering of 10/10 and 20/20 zigzag tests were conducted and analyzed in this study, as well as the new rudder model improved from the MMG model. The proposed procedure is used to identify all those hydrodynamic derivatives using both model tests and a very limited amount of fast VCTs. The identified hull and rudder parameters for the Optiwise are shown in \autoref{sec:coefficients}.
