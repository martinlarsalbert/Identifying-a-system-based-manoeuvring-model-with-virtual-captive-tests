\noindent The CFD calculations used to produce the VCT data for this paper used the double-body method, neglecting the free-surface effects, and thereby assuming that the forces from wave generation could be neglected. It was further assumed that the roll would not influence the manoeuvring performance either, by neglecting the roll degree of freedom.
However, it was found during the inverse dynamics analysis (see \autoref{sec:result_ID_wPCC}) that these assumptions might not be valid for the wPCC test case. 
Therefore, another test case Optiwise was also analyzed in the same way as wPCC. Optiwise was tested at a lower Froude number than wPCC, with less wave generation. Optiwise also had a much higher GM, and therefore rolled less during the maneuvers. It would therefore be easier to justify the above mentioned assumptions for Optiwise than for wPCC. 
The identified hull and rudder parameters for the Optiwise are shown in \autoref{sec:coefficients}.
