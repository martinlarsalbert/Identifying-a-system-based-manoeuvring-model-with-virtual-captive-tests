Another enhancement to the wPCC FRMTs, was the measurement of rudder forces for Optiwise.
The rudder model within the Optiwise simulation model could then be replaced by the actual measured rudder forces, so that the hull prediction model could be assessed in isolation. There was generally good agreement between the predictions of the model and the corresponding inverse dynamics forces for zigzag10/10  and zigzag20/20 as shown in \autoref{fig:ID_optiwise}. The model uncertainty was low, which was assessed in the same way as for the wPCC test case.
Despite the overall good agreement, deviations were observed for the sway force $Y_D$ for about 3 seconds after rudder changes at t = 11--14 s and t = 35--38 s, for zigzag10/10 and t = 11--14 s, t = 35--38 s, t = 64 s, for zigzag20/20. The model and state VCT calculations predict a more straight line in the $Y_D$ time series around these deviation points. 
During the work in this article, a reasonable explanation for these deviations has not been found, where filtration errors in the EKF were ruled out as a possible explanation by conducting alternative analysis with a low-pass filter instead of the EKF. Accelerations were instead calculated with numeric differentiation of low-pass filtered signals of repeated zigzag10/10 tests as shown in \autoref{fig:lowpass_deviation_points}.

Given the good results with the measured rudder model, the focus was on finding a good rudder force prediction model for Optiwise. The MMG original model and the MMG quadratic model, proposed in this paper, were fitted to the rudder forces from the VCT data. These models predicted similar forces during the zigzag tests that agree quite well with the measured forces, especially for the zigzag20/20 test, as shown in \autoref{fig:rudder_forces_zigzag_10_10} and \autoref{fig:rudder_forces_zigzag_20_20}.
The similar agreement achieved by the measured rudder model could now be achieved by models equipped with MMG rudder models, as shown in \autoref{fig:ID_optiwise20}.
