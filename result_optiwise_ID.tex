The rudder model within the Optiwise simulation model was replaced by the actual measured rudder forces during the experiments. There was generally good agreement between predictions with the measured rudder model and the corresponding inverse dynamics forces for the zigzag10/10 (\autoref{fig:ID_measured_rudder_zigzag_10_10}) and zigzag20/20 (\autoref{fig:ID_measured_rudder_zigzag_20_20}).
Deviations were however observed for the sway force $Y_D$ during about 3 seconds after the rudder changes at t=11--14 s, and t=35--38 s, for the zigzag10/10 and t=11--14 s, t=35--38 s, t=64 s, for the zigzag20/20. The model and state VCT calculations predict a more straight line in the $Y_D$ time series around these deviation points. 
A reasonable explanation to these deviations has not been found during the work for this paper, where filtration errors in the EKF were ruled out as a possible explanation, by conducting alternative analysis with a low-pass filter instead of the EKF. Accelerations were instead calculated with numeric differentiation of the low-pass filtered signals of repeated zigzag10/10 tests as shown in \autoref{fig:lowpass_deviation_points}.

Given the good results with the measured rudder model, focus was on finding a good rudder force prediction model for Optiwise. The MMG original model and the MMG quadratic model -- proposed in this paper -- where fitted to the rudder forces from the VCT data. These models predicted similar forces during the zigzag tests which agreed quite well with the measured forces, especially for the zigzag20/20 test, as shown in \autoref{fig:ID_measured_rudder_zigzag_10_10} and \autoref{fig:ID_measured_rudder_zigzag_20_20}.

Similar agreement achieved by the measured rudder model could now be achieved by the models equipped with MMG rudder models, as shown in \autoref{fig:ID_optiwise20}.
