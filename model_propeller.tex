\noindent The surge forces from the propeller are taken as the propeller thrust multiplied by a thrust deduction factor $t_{df}$ as:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:X_P}
    X_P = (1-t_{df})T
\end{equation}
where, in this study, the propeller thrust $T$ is proposed to be taken from the measured thrust from either virtual captive tests (VCTs) or free-running model tests (FRMTs) to reduce the uncertainty of the complex interaction between the propeller, rudder, and hull. The propeller also generates side forces, especially for yaw rates, which have a small stabilizing effect on the ship. The stabilizing propeller moment can be around 5\% of the rudder yawing moment, as shown in \autoref{fig:propeller_size_force}.
This effect is not explicitly modeled in this study, hence, $Y_P=0$,$N_P=0$. However, the propeller side force is included in the VCT data, so that the propeller side force is instead included in the hull coefficients.
