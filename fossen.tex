The shipâ€™s kinematics are expressed amidship in a ship fixed reference frame, rotated around the Earth fixed axis $x_0$ by the heading angle $\Psi$. Forces and motions are expressed in the surge $X$, sway $Y$ , and yaw $N$ degrees of freedom. The kinematics can be expressed as function of a velocity vector $\mathbf{\upsilon}$, since the forces do not depend on the position ($x_0,y_0$) or heading $\Psi$, during the manoeuvre.
