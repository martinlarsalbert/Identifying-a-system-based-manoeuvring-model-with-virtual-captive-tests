The VCT was primarily used for the structured state and input variations as described in \autoref{sec:methodology_VCT}. However, some VCT calculations were also conducted for a selection of the states $\pmb{\bm{\upsilon}}$ and inputs $\mathbf{u}$ during the zigzag tests. This state VCT calculations were conducted to see if the fitted manoeuvring models predict the same forces as the CFD calculations.
