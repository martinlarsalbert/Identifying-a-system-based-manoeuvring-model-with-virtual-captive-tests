\noindent The VCT was primarily used for the structured state and input variations as described in \autoref{sec:methodology_VCT}. However, some VCT calculations were also conducted for a selection of the states $\pmb{\bm{\upsilon}}$ and inputs $\mathbf{u}$ encountered by the ship during the zigzag tests. In this study, these state VCT calculations were conducted to see if the fitted manoeuvring models predict the same forces as the CFD calculations.
