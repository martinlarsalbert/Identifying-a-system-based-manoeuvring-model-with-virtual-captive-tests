\noindent The forces predicted with the wPCC model equipped with the semi-empirical rudder model have been compared with the inverse dynamics forces from the zigzag10/10 and zigzag20/20 tests as well as some state VCT calculations during the tests as shown in \autoref{fig:ID_wPCC_10} and \autoref{fig:ID_wPCC_20}. 
The model describes the underlying VCT data well, with reasonably good agreement with the state VCT, especially for the yawing moment of the rudder $N_R$. However, the inverse dynamics forces from the experiments were quite different. This indicates that there could be an inherent error in the VCT data itself, which is thus inherited by the model. The good agreement between the rudder forces points towards an error in the hull forces, which could be connected with the missing wave generation forces in the VCT data, or the exclusion of ship roll in the model.
