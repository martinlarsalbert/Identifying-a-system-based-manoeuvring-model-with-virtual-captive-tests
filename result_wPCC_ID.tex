Forces predicted with the wPCC model equipped with either the semi-empirical rudder or the polynomial rudder have been compared with forces from the experiments, estimated by inverse dynamics. The semi-empirical model predicts larger yawing moment $N_D$ than the experiments or the polynomial model for the zigzag10/10 in \autoref{fig:ID_wPCC_10} and even more pronounced for the 20/20 test as shown in \autoref{fig:ID_wPCC_20}.

The $N_D$ deviations between the experiments and the force prediction model with semi-empirical rudder are of the same magnitude as the the difference between the rudder yawing moment $N_R$ predictions with the polynomial and semi-empirical rudder. This is especially pronounced for the zigzag20/20 (\autoref{fig:ID_wPCC_20}) which suggests that the deviations of the total yawing moment $N_D$ from the semi-empirical model originates from the rudder model predictions of $N_R$.

There is generally good agreement between the polynomial model and the experiments. There are however some yawing moment $N_D$ deviations at t=9.5 s, and t=27 s, during the changes of rudder angle. 

Extra VCT calculations have been conducted for some of the states during the maneuvers. There is generally a good agreement between these calculated states and the experimental forces. There are however small deviations for the yawing moment, especially around the rudder angle changes.
