	abstract = {The prediction of the behavior of ships in a seaway has been an important topic in ship design since the beginning of modern naval architecture. In recent years, computer simulations using numerical methods based on mathematical models of the ship hydrodynamics problem has become a valuable tool for researchers and engineers working in this field. A large variety of methods with different levels of sophistication and accuracy already exist today, all being suitable for specific problems. However, with the current trend of larger, more advanced and optimized designs and focus turning more and more towards safety and energy efficiency, nonlinear phenomena are becoming more important and many of the traditional methods have problems in producing accurate results for certain cases due to assumptions and neglected physical effects in the underlying mathematical model. The overall objective of this project is the development and implementation of a fully nonlinear unsteady three-dimensional boundary element method for ship motion analysis, applicable to problems with a high degree of nonlinearities while still being suitable for practical use. The method is capable of predicting wave induced loads and motions with actual forward speed, taking into account implicitly all kinds of nonlinearities, i.e. higher and lower order frequency components, hull shape above the calm water level and self interaction between the forward speed flow field as well as radiated and diffracted waves. This thesis presents the mathematical model, the numerical method and numerical results obtained from the application of the method to a number of relevant test cases. Results from the application of the method are provided, including the propagation of a regular long-crested wave, the wave resistance problem in calm water and the radiation and diffraction problem in regular and irregular head sea. The results are limited to heave and pitch motions and are compared with analytical or experimental data, numerical results from other methods or, in some cases, both. The method has proved to be able to capture strong nonlinear effects in heave and pitch motions and its feasibility as a qualified analysis tool for such cases has been demonstrated.},

	abstract = {Parameter drift is a tricky problem in system identification, and collinearity in the identified model is considered to be its
cause in the field of statistical learning. To diminish the
parameter drift and identify the model parameters more
accurately, a better understanding of the characteristics of
collinearity is necessary. System identification is one of the
effective modeling methods in the study of ship
manoeuvrability. This paper aims at quantifying and analyzing
the collinearity in the modeling of ship manoeuvring motion by
using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF). By utilizing the multiple
datasets including those from zigzag and turning tests and the
combinations of manoeuvres, as well as the data processed by
D-optimizing design or difference method, the VIF is applied to
quantify the severity of collinearity of different model
structures. The results show that the selected manoeuvring
models have high collinearity under the data of single standard
manoeuvre. The pre-processed test data and an appropriate
model structure can alleviate the collinearity, hence to diminish the parameter drift. However, the collinearity of the selected
models cannot be eliminated. Some suggestions are given for
selecting more appropriate training data and mathematical
model structures of ship manoeuvring to accurately estimate the
model parameters.},

	abstract = {The SIMMAN 2008 workshop was held in Copenhagen, Denmark in April 2008. The purpose of the workshop was to benchmark the prediction capabilities of different ship maneuvering simulation methods including systems- and CFD-based methods through systematic quantitative comparisons and validation against EFD data for tanker (KVLCC), container ship (KCS), and surface combatant (5415) hull form test cases. For the KVLCC test case, two stern shape variants named KVLCC1 and KVLCC2 giving different instability loops were included. Free model test data was compared with systems-based methods and CFD for specified free maneuvers. Some of the systems-based methods used provided PMM and CMT data, and two used CFD instead. CFD-based methods were used to simulate forced motions and were compared with PMM/CMT model test data. The submissions were blind in the sense that the benchmark model test data was not provided prior to the workshop, unless data was required as input to the simulation method. A total of 64 submissions were received for the free maneuver simulations, which included a wide range of the state-of-the-art methods in use today, such as PMM- and CMT-based methods, CFD based methods, system identification, neural network tools and various empirical methods. For the forced motion simulations a total of 16 submissions were received, comprising different CFD-based methods such as RANS, URANS, and DES. This paper gives an overview of hulls, model tests, test cases, submissions, comparison results as well as the most important observations and conclusions.},

The hydrodynamic derivatives in an Abkowitz model are determined by the Lagrangian factors and the support vectors in the SVM regression model. To obtain the optimized structural factors in SVM, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is incorporated into SVM. To diminish the drift of hydrodynamic derivatives after regression, a difference method is adopted to reconstruct the training samples before identification. The validity of the difference method is verified by correlation analysis. Based on the Abkowitz mathematical model, the simulation of ship maneuvering motion is conducted.

Many simulation methods sometimes harm the adaptability of hydrodynamic force data for the maneuvering simulations since one method may be not applicable to other method in general. To avoid this, basic part of the method should be common. Under such a background, research committee on “standardization of mathematical model for ship maneuvering predictions” was organized by the Japan Society of Naval Architects and Ocean Engineers and proposed a prototype of maneuvering prediction method for ships, called “MMG standard method”. In this article, the MMG standard method is introduced. The MMG standard method is composed of 4 elements; maneuvering simulation model, procedure of the required captive model tests to capture the hydrodynamic force characteristics, analysis method for determining the hydrodynamic force coefficients for maneuvering simulations, and prediction method for maneuvering motions of a ship in fullscale. KVLCC2 tanker is selected as a sample ship and the captive mode test results are presented with a process of the data analysis. Using the hydrodynamic force coefficients presented, maneuvering simulations are carried out for KVLCC2 model and the fullscale ship for validation of the method. The present method can roughly capture the maneuvering motions and is useful for the maneuvering predictions in fullscale.},

	abstract = {Maneuverability is an important hydrodynamic performance of a ship, and should be taken into account during the ship design stage. The present study of Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) calculations aims to offer a numerical tool for maneuvering prediction with high accuracy. The virtual captive model tests for a model scale KCS container ship are conducted using unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) computation to obtain the full set of linear and nonlinear hydrodynamic derivatives in the 3rd-order Abkowitz model. The numerical uncertainty analysis is carried out for the pure sway and yaw-drift tests to verify the numerical accuracy. It is concluded that the lower order Fourier coefficients are preferred in the computation of the hydrodynamic derivatives. Moreover, part of the computed hydrodynamic forces and moments are compared with the available captive model test data, and good agreement is obtained. By substituting the computed hydrodynamic derivatives into the mathematical model, the standard turning and zigzag maneuvers are predicted. By comparing the predicted maneuvering results with the available experimental data and the prediction results by others, it is demonstrated that acceptable prediction accuracy can be achieved with the present method, which shows the effectiveness of the present method in predicting ship maneuverability. © 2018 The Author(s).},

A parameter estimation is proposed to identify the hydrodynamic derivatives. The most suitable manoeuvring model is found using the parameter estimation with cross-validation on a set of competing manoeuvring models. The parameter estimation uses inverse dynamics regression and Extended Kalman filter (EKF) with a Rauch Tung Striebel (RTS) smoother. Two case study vessels, wPCC and KVLCC2, with very different maneuverability characteristics are used to demonstrate and validate the proposed method.

The geometry is David Taylor Model Basin (DTMB) model 5512, a 3.048m geosim of DTMB model 5415. The experiments are done in a 100m×3m×3m towing tank. The measurement system is a custom-designed towing tank maneuvering test flow-mapping system, which features a PMM for captive model testing with an integrated stereoscopic PIV. Statistical convergence error is defined and monitored by using the confidence intervals of the mean and variance. The quality of data is also assessed by following standard uncertainty assessment procedures. The present experimental data are cross-referenced with computational simulations for identification of the major vortices in the flow. The core locations and trajectories of the major vortices are traced and the flow variables at the core locations are analyzed. The tests of both Parts I and II are sufficiently documented and detailed to be useful as experimental benchmark data for validation of CFD codes.

The amount of information is quantified by the D-optimality criterion, and the optimal solution is calculated by the ant colony optimization algorithm. Monte Carlo analysis and generalization validation are conducted to evaluate the optimized signals. The superiority of the optimized excitation signal is demonstrated by comparing with the widely used zigzag manoeuvre signal. In the presence of noise interference, the application of the optimized training data reduces the variance of parameter estimation and improves the generalization ability of the identified model, especially for the surge equation.},

The initial model of vessel steering is derived by a modified second-order Nomoto model (i.e., nonlinear vessel steering with stochastic state-parameter conditions). However, that model introduces various difficulties in system identification, due to the presence of a large number of states and parameters and system nonlinearities. Therefore, partial feedback linearization is proposed to simplify the proposed model, where the system-model unstructured uncertainties can also be separated. Furthermore, partial feedback linearization reduces the number of states and parameters and the system nonlinearities, given the resulting reduced-order state model. Then, the system identification approach is carried out, for both models (i.e., full state model and reduced-order state model), resorting to an extended Kalman filter (EKF). As illustrated in the results, the reduced-order model was able to successfully identify the required states and parameters when compared to the full state model in vessel steering under persistent excitation maneuvers. Therefore, the proposed approach can be used in a wide range of system identification applications.},

However, there is a trade-off between accuracy and interpretability, which highlights the need for a modeling approach that balances both factors. To address this challenge, this paper presents a novel, open-source, physically motivated data-driven method named hydrodynamic dictionary library-inspired adaptive regression (HLAR). This approach combines hydrodynamic terms from classical models to form a priori dictionary and utilizes the sequential thresholded least-squares (STLS) algorithm and Bayesian optimization to identify model counterparts and adaptively optimize the hyperparameters. The proposed method was validated using KVLCC2 ship experimental data, NPS-AUV simulation data and Star Ocean II AUV experimental data, and it can achieve both high accuracy and good interpretability with low complexity. Experimental results show that the proposed method is 100 times faster than the Gaussian process and achieves the same level of accuracy.},

To be able to construct such models is therefore a fundamental skill in modern engineering.This is a book about how to build models both from first principles in physics and from information in collected input and output measurements from the system.Physical modeling is nowadays typically done by object oriented software, such as Modelica and Matlab's Simscape. These techniques are described in the book, together with their theoretical and mathematical underlying principles. Domain-independent methods, such as following energy flows in bond graphs gives a useful background for understanding object oriented modeling. Both classical state-space models and general differential algebraic equations (DAE) are treated.The book also gives a comprehensive treatment of system identification, that is, techniques to estimate mathematical models from measured system inputs and outputs. Both linear and nonlinear models are treated, including artificial neural networks.The text is related to the Swedish text Modellbygge och Simulering, Studentlitteratur, 2003. It also has some roots in the book Modeling of Dynamic Systems, Prentice Hall, 1994.The currrent 2nd edition of book has been extended with more material on the statistical roots of the area, a treatment of so called subspace methods and an orientation on neural networks, deep nets and deep learning."

	abstract = {System identification offers ways to obtain proper models describing a ship’s dynamics in real operational conditions but poses significant challenges, such as the multicollinearity and generality of the identified model. This paper proposes a new physics-informed ship manoeuvring model, where a deterministic semi-empirical rudder model has been added, to guide the identification towards a physically correct hydrodynamic model. This is an essential building block to distinguish the hydrodynamic modelling uncertainties from wind, waves, and currents – in real sea conditions – which is particularly important for ships with wind-assisted propulsion. In the physics-informed manoeuvring modelling framework, a systematical procedure is developed to establish various force/motion components within the manoeuvring system by inverse dynamics regression. The novel test case wind-powered pure car carrier (wPCC) assesses the physical correctness. First, a reference model, assumed to resemble the physically correct kinetics, is established via parameter identification on virtual captive tests. Then, the model tests are used to build both the physics-informed model and a physics-uninformed mathematical model for comparison. All models predicted the zigzag tests with satisfactory agreement. Thus, they can indeed be considered as being mathematically correct. However, introducing a semi-empirical rudder model seems to have guided the identification towards a more physically correct calm water hydrodynamic model, having lower multicollinearity and better generalization.},

	abstract = {Model-scale measurements and full-scale sea trials were compared to numerical simulations of different ship maneuvers. Simulations were performed using codes that solve the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations coupled with the nonlinear rigid body equations of motion. Different time scales existing between ship motions and fluid flow as well as diverging spatial discretizations of hull and propulsor in conjunction with the propulsor’s rotation increased the required computational efforts, rendering the model unsuitable for comprehensive parametric investigations. To overcome these difficulties, a mixture between mesh morphing for small-scale motions and global displacement of the mesh for large-scale motions was developed. Previous investigations mostly replicated captive model tests or resolved the viscous flow more precisely to explore various dedicated effects. RANS simulations offer valuable insight into scale effects involved in maneuvering prediction as they allow the study of both ship and model scale flows. This paper explores the reliability of both direct maneuvering simulation (using a combination of a freely moving ship including the rotating propulsor) and simulations based upon the virtual replication of captive model tests (using Taylor-series expansions to model the external hydrodynamic forces). The influence of engine-propulsor interaction in maneuvering motion behavior and scale effects is discussed. Predictions are compared to model tests and sea trials.},

Static Oblique Towing Test (OTT) and dynamic Circular Motion Test (CMT) are both performed to acquire necessary data for the MMG model identification. The forces and moments acting on ship hull are predicted by solving unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations. The MMG hydrodynamic derivatives are obtained with the results of captive model tests. In the free-running simulations, to reduce the computational cost of considerable propeller grids, a body force propeller method is introduced to provide thrust forces directly, and the ship motion is handled by overset grids of ship hull and rudder. A 3-degree of freedom MMG model is identified with numerical simulation results, i.e., the self-propulsion test, rudder angle 35°turning test and 15/1 zig-zag test, for a standard KRISO Container Ship (KCS).

	abstract = {Azimuth-Stern-Drive tugs have relatively simple hull form, great propulsive performance and maneuverability, and these characteristics provide study advantages over cargo ships and other ship forms. At the pre-processing stage, ship maneuvering prediction based on CFD codes solving the RANSE are with successful applications. However, the work of obtaining the hydrodynamic derivatives and maneuvering coefficients needs to deal with water surface effects and propeller rotating motion, which is very time-consuming. Thereby, it is necessary to explore an appropriate CFD application strategy for ship maneuvering prediction, to balance the numerical accuracy and time costs. In this paper, a self-built low-speed ship motion control experimental platform, ’QiuXin V’, modified from a harbor tug, is studied. Double-body assumption combined with discretized propeller method is adopted to perform series of virtual captive model tests and self propulsion tests, to obtain the hydrodynamic derivatives, thruster performance, and maneuvering coefficients in straight moving conditions, while the flow attributes associated with the ducted thruster are predicted with empirical methods. Moreover, a modified steering force model is introduced to improve the maneuvering model accuracy. Non-disturbance turning and zigzag maneuvers are performed and compared with free-running model tests. Results show acceptable model accuracy and confirm the feasibility of the adopted integrated method in predicting the ASD ship maneuverability under low-speed conditions.},

The model tests were conducted using a ship model of length 3.057 m in a square tank at the National Research Institute of Fisheries Engineering, Japan. The wave conditions were as follows: the wave height was 3.6 m at full-scale, ratio of wavelength to ship length was 1.0, and the ship approached in the head wave direction before it was steered. The present method can simulate both the turning motion and wave-induced motions in regular waves with practical accuracy.},

	abstract = {The need for pollution reduction of commercial shipping might make the reintroduction of sail propulsion desirable. A ship under sail will travel with a drift angle due to the side forces created by the sail. This leads to non-axial inflow on the propeller, named oblique flow. The effect of oblique inflow on the propeller's performance has previously been researched for large angles up to 30. This paper outlines the effect for angles between 0 and 10, which was thus far unknown. A numerical model, that proved its applicability for large angles, was used. Results showed an increase for both dimensionless thrust and torque, KT \& KQ, which led to an increase of the propeller's performance. Also open water propeller tests, performed at the TU Delft, were conducted. Tests showed a more significant increase for all values than the model did. The model makes assumptions that led to an underestimation. Open water tests, conducted at a too low Reynolds number, resulted in an overestimation. Neither method is sufficient for estimation of the propeller's performance in oblique flow. We conclude that the truth lies somewhere in between both outcomes. For further analysis more open water tests need to be conducted at a higher Reynolds number to eliminate scale errors.},

In the present study, the effect of oblique flow on propeller lateral loads is numerically investigated based on URANS method, coupled with SST k-ω turbulent model and sliding mesh method. An 82, 000 DWT bulk carrier with a single right-handed screw is computed. Both open water and behind-hull conditions are simulated for a range of drift angles from −20 to 20°. The lateral loads in open water increase with the drift angle increasing in a slightly non-linear trend. However, the behind-hull results are quite different from that in open water. At behind-hull conditions, the horizontal loads monotonously, non-linearly increase as the drift angle increases, while the vertical loads peak at the −5 deg drift angle (corresponding to the transverse flow coming from the portside). In large drift angles, the behind-hull lateral loads reach a larger percentage of the axial loads compared with the open-water results. Scale effect is also investigated by simulating the behind-hull flows with three scales. It is revealed that the increase in scales causes a slight decrease on the horizontal loads independently of drift angles, while it causes a remarkable increase and decrease on the vertical components for positive and negative drift angles, respectively.},

Open deck areas, high stability characteristics, and a wide range of operating speeds are some of the strong sides of these vessels. The fact that few studies have been done on manoeuvring performance predictions of these types of ships has been the main source of motivation in conducting this study. A fast multihull form, Delft Catamaran 372 (DC372), has been selected for computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-based system simulation application. CFD method has been subjected to a verification and validation (V\&V) process using the latest solution verification techniques and available comparison data in the literature. The computerized planar motion mechanism (CPMM) approach has been applied to determine all the necessary hydrodynamic derivatives stated in Abkowitz’s manoeuvring model. A new approach to analysis of manoeuvring performance of multihull vessels, discrete study of hull components (DSHC), has been introduced for the interpretation of manoeuvring coefficients. The dynamic manoeuvre system simulator (DynaMaSS) in which a waterjet and conventional steering/propulsion units (SPUs) are implemented, has been presented for the 20-degree turning circle (TC20) and 20/20 zigzag (ZZ20) manoeuvre simulations of DC372. The manoeuvring coefficients of DC372 have been determined at a satisfactory level by the CFD method. Successful results and solution strategies have been presented for DC372.},

The PMM experiments comprise both static test, i.e. oblique towing test, and dynamic tests, i.e. pure sway test, pure surge test, pure yaw test, and yaw test with constant drift angle. In order to obtain high-quality data, a band-pass filter was adopted to pass frequencies within a given range and attenuate high-frequency vibrations as well as background noises. Subsequently, a Fourier transform would be considered to evaluate the maneuvering derivatives based on their motion characteristics. It is worth to mention that the maneuvering derivatives derived from the static tests are in good agreement with the results published by the David Taylor Research Center (DTRC). In the view of steering efficiency, it is inclined to conduct rotation movement rather than transverse movement in SUBOFF operations by analyzing special maneuvering derivatives.},

Self-propulsion results, and motions, forces, moments and mean flow field during the maneuver agree well with experiments and discretized propeller simulations. The approach is an effective and economical way to perform direct simulation of surface ship maneuvers, providing CPU time savings approaching an order of magnitude.

	abstract = {Simulations of standard manoeuvring tests require a good estimation of the hydrodynamic derivatives. These are extracted from the hydrodynamic forces applying on the ship. The present work focuses on the investigation of the importance of free surface assessment on the estimation of the hydrodynamic forces, particularly, in the presence of the ship–bottom interaction and when certain parameters are varied, including the ship’s speed and the drift angle. This investigation aims, in particular, to mark off the confidence Interval of neglecting free surface deformation hypothesis by comparing the results of static drift test with and without considering this assumption. The study was carried on a 135 m inland containership at a scale ratio of 1:25 undergoing static drift tests. In order to recreate the ship–bottom interaction, the depth to draft ratio (h/T) is varied to obtain four channel configurations. The tests are performed by numerical code under the commercial software Ansys Fluent by solving Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes Equations(RANSE) coupled to a \$\$k -{\textbackslash}omega\$\$SST turbulence model. To investigate the effect of free surface modelling, the hydrodynamic forces are compared when the free surface separating air and water is considered, using Volume Of Fluid (VOF) method, and when the free surface is neglected. The simulations are carried out for various ship speeds and various drift angles.},

	abstract = {Low transverse metacentric height and high speed are peculiar destabilising factors in ship manoeuvrability according to the attainable large heeling angles. The phenomenon indeed occurs in the case of vessels characterised by loading conditions with low transverse stability — e.g. high centre of mass of container vessels and RoRos. Starting from Kijima’s single-screw container vessel evidence, an extension of the study to twin-screw ferry vessels is undertaken, with the scope of quantifying its effect in terms of turning and zig-zag IMO margins at an early design stage. Given the relevant impact, an enlarged captive model testing campaign executed on a sample of reference vessels was analysed to further characterise and extend the concepts to a broader class of modern single and twin-screw vessels, thus motivating the study. As a further result, this analysis allowed to underline the need of a review of the IMO intact stability code when dealing with heeling angle during a turn.},

The PMM model tests are carried out in the towing tank of Marine Design and Research Institute of China (MARIC) and the numerical simulations are performed using the open-source CFD library OpenFOAM. Validations of the numerical methods are provided by comparison with experimental measurements. The grid convergence study is performed in the authors previous literature, which is based on several oblique towing tests of the ONRT hull and is also brieflyillustrated in this article. The numerical results show that, for dynamic PMM cases, the predicted amplitude of lateral force and yaw moment are smaller than the measured data and there is slight phase difference between numerical results and the experimental measurements. The calculated time changing longitudinal force is not consistent with the experimental data but the discrepancy between the mean value is reasonable.Similar phenomenon is also given in other literatures.},

	abstract = {In the present paper, the analysis of the turning capability of the naval supply vessel presented in Part I (Broglia et al., 2015) is continued with different stern appendages, namely twin rudder and centreline skeg. The main purpose of the analysis is to assess the capability of an in-house CFD tool in capturing the different manoeuvring characteristics of the ship hulls; the test case is challenging, as the difference between the two configurations lies in the complex flow structure related to rudder–propeller interactions. Moreover, although the twin rudder solution slightly improves the poor course keeping ability of the original vessel, the course stability remains poor and, consequently, large lateral motions and drift angle have to be expected during the manoeuvre. The manoeuvring capabilities of the new configuration are discussed and compared with the single rudder configuration, focusing on the nature of the hydrodynamic forces and moments acting on the main hull and appendages during the transient and stabilized phases of the manoeuvre. Emphasis will be also given to the different contributions of the propulsion system in the twin rudder configuration, that results from the different rudder–propeller interaction.},

In this study, both maneuvering coefficients and wave model in the mathematical model are improved utilizing system identificationSystem identificationtechnique and CFD free running outputs. From turning circle and zigzag calm water CFD free running data, the maneuvering coefficients are estimated. The wave correction parameters are introduced to improve the wave model, which are found from a few forced and free running CFD simulations in waves. The mathematical model with the improved parameters shows much better agreement with experiments in both calm water and waves than the original mathematical model. The original mathematical model was based on the maneuvering coefficients estimated from several captive tests and wave forces calculated from linear Froude-Krylov forces and diffraction forces based on a slender ship theory.},
