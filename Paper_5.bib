  abstract = {An accurately predicted dynamic model is essentially required to design a robust control system for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) maneuvering in six degrees of freedom. The dynamic model consists of hydrodynamic derivatives which include inertial and damping coefficients. Traditionally, these coefficients can be estimated through Analytical and Semi-Empirical (ASE) methods, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), and through experiments such as captive or free model testing. Additionally, System Identification (SI) estimators, e.g. extended Kalman filter, are also employed to predict the complete set of parameters. Recently, with the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in almost every field of science, supervised machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and neural network algorithms are also being applied to predict the coefficients with lesser computational cost and higher accuracy. Additionally, AI based parametric and non-parametric modeling of autonomous marine vehicles have also been discussed. Accordingly, the contributions of researchers and scientists, with respect to the evolution and application of these important techniques for marine vehicles, particularly torpedo-shaped AUVs, done over the past more than 75 years, have been thoroughly surveyed and sequentially consolidated in this article. At the end, based on the survey, merits and demerits of each technique over the others have been highlighted and published results have also been discussed to evaluate the effectiveness of these estimation techniques for autonomous underwater vehicles.},

  abstract = {System identification offers ways to obtain proper models describing a ship’s dynamics in real operational conditions but poses significant challenges, such as the multicollinearity and generality of the identified model. This paper proposes a new physics-informed ship manoeuvring model, where a deterministic semi-empirical rudder model has been added, to guide the identification towards a physically correct hydrodynamic model. This is an essential building block to distinguish the hydrodynamic modelling uncertainties from wind, waves, and currents – in real sea conditions – which is particularly important for ships with wind-assisted propulsion. In the physics-informed manoeuvring modelling framework, a systematical procedure is developed to establish various force/motion components within the manoeuvring system by inverse dynamics regression. The novel test case wind-powered pure car carrier (wPCC) assesses the physical correctness. First, a reference model, assumed to resemble the physically correct kinetics, is established via parameter identification on virtual captive tests. Then, the model tests are used to build both the physics-informed model and a physics-uninformed mathematical model for comparison. All models predicted the zigzag tests with satisfactory agreement. Thus, they can indeed be considered as being mathematically correct. However, introducing a semi-empirical rudder model seems to have guided the identification towards a more physically correct calm water hydrodynamic model, having lower multicollinearity and better generalization.},

  abstract = {Dynamic modeling of unmanned marine vehicles (UMVs) plays an integral role in implementing the autopilot and intelligence capabilities of these vehicles. However, there is a trade-off between accuracy and interpret-ability, which highlights the need for a modeling approach that balances both factors. To address this challenge, this paper presents a novel, open-source, physically motivated data-driven method named hydrodynamic dictionary library-inspired adaptive regression (HLAR). This approach combines hydrodynamic terms from classical models to form a priori dictionary and utilizes the sequential thresholded least-squares (STLS) algorithm and Bayesian optimization to identify model counterparts and adaptively optimize the hyperparameters. The proposed method was validated using KVLCC2 ship experimental data, NPS-AUV simulation data and Star Ocean II AUV experimental data, and it can achieve both high accuracy and good interpretability with low complexity. Experimental results show that the proposed method is 100 times faster than the Gaussian process and achieves the same level of accuracy.},

From turning circle and zigzag calm water CFD free running data, the maneuvering coefficients are estimated. The wave correction parameters are introduced to improve the wave model, which are found from a few forced and free running CFD simulations in waves. The mathematical model with the improved parameters shows much better agreement with experiments in both calm water and waves than the original mathematical model. The original mathematical model was based on the maneuvering coefficients estimated from several captive tests and wave forces calculated from linear Froude-Krylov forces and diffraction forces based on a slender ship theory.},

As a necessary technology of MASS, ship motion prediction still has some problems, such as low efficiency, poor real-time performance, and easy to be affected by sea conditions. Aiming at the above problems, based on the mathematical model of ship maneuvering motion, this paper uses the least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) identification algorithm, to establish an offline black-box identification model of MASS motion considering rudder angle and propeller revolution rates, and effectively predicts the motion of ships. On this basis, a sliding window is designed, and an error-based online modeling method of ship motion is proposed to realize adaptive prediction of MASS motion under the effect of ocean waves. A large MASS was selected for modeling and simulation experiments. The results show that compared with the traditional LS-SVM modeling algorithm, the model built by this method has a strong adaptive ability and can maintain high accuracy for a long time, meeting the needs of real-time prediction of MASS motion in practical applications.},

For the free-running test data, two zigzag manoeuvres are used: 30°−30° zigzag for identification and 20°−20° zigzag for validation. A nonlinear manoeuvring model is proposed based on the standard Euler equations, and the hydrodynamic coefficients are computed using empirical equations. To obtain robust results, the truncated singular value decomposition is employed to diminish the multicollinearity and the parameter uncertainties due to noise. The validation is carried out by comparing the result of the measured values with the predictions obtained using the manoeuvring models. Finally, a sensitivity analysis for the simulation data is performed to understand the influence of the parameters in the manoeuvres.},

  abstract = {The need for pollution reduction of commercial shipping might make the reintroduction of sail propulsion desirable. A ship under sail will travel with a drift angle due to the side forces created by the sail. This leads to non-axial inflow on the propeller, named oblique flow. The effect of oblique inflow on the propeller's performance has previously been researched for large angles up to 30. This paper outlines the effect for angles between 0 and 10, which was thus far unknown. A numerical model, that proved its applicability for large angles, was used. Results showed an increase for both dimensionless thrust and torque, KT \& KQ, which led to an increase of the propeller's performance. Also open water propeller tests, performed at the TU Delft, were conducted. Tests showed a more significant increase for all values than the model did. The model makes assumptions that led to an underestimation. Open water tests, conducted at a too low Reynolds number, resulted in an overestimation. Neither method is sufficient for estimation of the propeller's performance in oblique flow. We conclude that the truth lies somewhere in between both outcomes. For further analysis more open water tests need to be conducted at a higher Reynolds number to eliminate scale errors.},

Simulations were performed using codes that solve the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations coupled with the nonlinear rigid body equations of motion. Different time scales existing between ship motions and fluid flow as well as diverging spatial discretizations of hull and propulsor in conjunction with the propulsor’s rotation increased the required computational efforts, rendering the model unsuitable for comprehensive parametric investigations. To overcome these difficulties, a mixture between mesh morphing for small-scale motions and global displacement of the mesh for large-scale motions was developed. Previous investigations mostly replicated captive model tests or resolved the viscous flow more precisely to explore various dedicated effects. RANS simulations offer valuable insight into scale effects involved in maneuvering prediction as they allow the study of both ship and model scale flows. This paper explores the reliability of both direct maneuvering simulation (using a combination of a freely moving ship including the rotating propulsor) and simulations based upon the virtual replication of captive model tests (using Taylor-series expansions to model the external hydrodynamic forces). The influence of engine-propulsor interaction in maneuvering motion behavior and scale effects is discussed. Predictions are compared to model tests and sea trials.},

A 3DM-GX1 sensor, together with a protractor and Global Positioning System (GPS), has been used to measure the yaw and rudder angle, position, linear accelerations, and angular velocities of the vessel in different times. The hydrodynamic coefficients in the mathematical model are determined by the Extended Kalman filter method.

  abstract = {With the current developments of wind powered and wind assisted vessels comes the need for realistic ship model testing. Traditional test methods of free sailing models are somewhat limited by the difficulties to mimic the effects of the wind propulsion systems or at least for recreating them at the correct scale. Simulations are possible but time consuming and they cannot grasp all aspects that free sailing models comprise. At the KTH Maritime Robotics Laboratory, a 1:30 scale model of Oceanbird was developed and equipped with numerous sensors to enable accurate and realistic measurements while sailing in unrestrained waters. The paper presents the model’s equipment and experimental results showing the abilities of the sailing demonstrator to gather high quality data for manoeuvring and aerodynamic studies. In particular, the definition of a zigzag manoeuvre for sailing ships is explained and results of tests are evaluated regarding manoeuvrability and aerodynamics.},

A new system identification method for generating a low-speed maneuvering model using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and free running model tests is proposed in this study. We especially focus on a low-speed maneuver such as the final phase in berthing to achieve automatic berthing control. Accurate dynamic modeling with minimum modeling error is highly desired to establish a model-based control system. We propose a new loss function that reduces the effect of the noise included in the training data. Besides, we revealed the following facts - an RNN that ignores the memory before a certain time improved the prediction accuracy compared with the "standard" RNN, and the random maneuver test was effective in obtaining an accurate berthing maneuver model. In addition, several low-speed free running model tests were performed for the scale model of the M.V. Esso Osaka. As a result, this paper showed that the proposed method using a neural network model could accurately represent low-speed maneuvering motions.},

  abstract = {To obtain an accurate ship maneuverability model for motion prediction and autonomous navigation, a ship maneuverability modeling and numerical prediction method is proposed based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). A Mathematical Model Group (MMG) model is utilized to describe the ship maneuverability with data from virtual captive model and free-running tests. Static Oblique Towing Test (OTT) and dynamic Circular Motion Test (CMT) are both performed to acquire necessary data for the MMG model identification. The forces and moments acting on ship hull are predicted by solving unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations. The MMG hydrodynamic derivatives are obtained with the results of captive model tests. In the free-running simulations, to reduce the computational cost of considerable propeller grids, a body force propeller method is introduced to provide thrust forces directly, and the ship motion is handled by overset grids of ship hull and rudder. A 3-degree of freedom MMG model is identified with numerical simulation results, i.e., the self-propulsion test, rudder angle 35°turning test and 15/1 zig-zag test, for a standard KRISO Container Ship (KCS). These tests show that the motion prediction and free-running maneuvering results can agree with the standard experimental data well.},

The combination of system identification and intelligent optimization algorithm not only solves the parameter drift problem of system identification, but also compensates for the lack of real-time performance of existing algorithms. The effectiveness of the ML-MI-RLS algorithm is verified by parameter identification simulations.

However, there is a trade-off between accuracy and interpretability, which highlights the need for a modeling approach that balances both factors. To address this challenge, this paper presents a novel, open-source, physically motivated data-driven method named hydrodynamic dictionary library-inspired adaptive regression (HLAR). This approach combines hydrodynamic terms from classical models to form a priori dictionary and utilizes the sequential thresholded least-squares (STLS) algorithm and Bayesian optimization to identify model counterparts and adaptively optimize the hyperparameters. The proposed method was validated using KVLCC2 ship experimental data, NPS-AUV simulation data and Star Ocean II AUV experimental data, and it can achieve both high accuracy and good interpretability with low complexity. Experimental results show that the proposed method is 100 times faster than the Gaussian process and achieves the same level of accuracy.},

  abstract = {Maneuverability is an important hydrodynamic performance of a ship, and should be taken into account during the ship design stage. The present study of Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) calculations aims to offer a numerical tool for maneuvering prediction with high accuracy. The virtual captive model tests for a model scale KCS container ship are conducted using unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) computation to obtain the full set of linear and nonlinear hydrodynamic derivatives in the 3rd-order Abkowitz model. The numerical uncertainty analysis is carried out for the pure sway and yaw-drift tests to verify the numerical accuracy. It is concluded that the lower order Fourier coefficients are preferred in the computation of the hydrodynamic derivatives. Moreover, part of the computed hydrodynamic forces and moments are compared with the available captive model test data, and good agreement is obtained. By substituting the computed hydrodynamic derivatives into the mathematical model, the standard turning and zigzag maneuvers are predicted. By comparing the predicted maneuvering results with the available experimental data and the prediction results by others, it is demonstrated that acceptable prediction accuracy can be achieved with the present method, which shows the effectiveness of the present method in predicting ship maneuverability. © 2018 The Author(s).},

Domain-independent methods, such as following energy flows in bond graphs gives a useful background for understanding object oriented modeling.

  abstract = {System identification of vessel steering associated with unstructured uncertainties is considered in this paper. The initial model of vessel steering is derived by a modified second-order Nomoto model (i.e., nonlinear vessel steering with stochastic state-parameter conditions). However, that model introduces various difficulties in system identification, due to the presence of a large number of states and parameters and system nonlinearities. Therefore, partial feedback linearization is proposed to simplify the proposed model, where the system-model unstructured uncertainties can also be separated. Furthermore, partial feedback linearization reduces the number of states and parameters and the system nonlinearities, given the resulting reduced-order state model. Then, the system identification approach is carried out, for both models (i.e., full state model and reduced-order state model), resorting to an extended Kalman filter (EKF). As illustrated in the results, the reduced-order model was able to successfully identify the required states and parameters when compared to the full state model in vessel steering under persistent excitation maneuvers. Therefore, the proposed approach can be used in a wide range of system identification applications.},

The results are analyzed in view of: (1) the verification for iterative, grid, and time-step convergence along with assessment of overall numerical uncertainty; and (2) validations for forces and moment coefficients, hydrodynamic derivatives, and reconstruction of forces and moment coefficients from resultant hydrodynamic derivatives together with the available experimental data. Part 2 provides the validation for flow features with the experimental data as well as investigations for flow physics, e.g., flow separation, three dimensional vortical structure, and reconstructed local flows.},

Several groups of full-scale maneuvering experiments have been implemented to collect research data. A linear responding ship motion model is selected for analysis, and specifically identification of two parameters of the model becomes the research topic. Based on the error criterion in SI theory, a Particle Swarm optimization (PSO) based search process is used for parameter identification under the principle of minimizing the sum of squares due to error (SSE). The accuracy of the estimated values is checked by comparing the simulated ship motion (model output using identified parameters) and the full-scale ship maneuvering trial record (ship output by measurement). The feasibility and availability of the developed strategy are verified by using a case study. It is concluded that the proposed strategy can provide technical support for full-scale ship motion modeling.},

A new system identification method for generating a low-speed maneuvering model using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and free running model tests is proposed in this study. We especially focus on a low-speed maneuver such as the final phase in berthing to achieve automatic berthing control. Accurate dynamic modeling with minimum modeling error is highly desired to establish a model-based control system. We propose a new loss function that reduces the effect of the noise included in the training data. Besides, we revealed the following facts—an RNN that ignores the memory before a certain time improved the prediction accuracy compared with the “standard” RNN, and the manual~random maneuver test was effective in obtaining an accurate berthing maneuver model. In addition, several low-speed free running model tests were performed for the scale model of the M.V. Esso Osaka. As a result, this paper showed that the proposed method using a neural network model could accurately represent low-speed maneuvering motions.},

In this paper, the identification procedure for a 3 degree of freedom hydrodynamic model under disturbance is completed based on the support vector machine with multiple manoeuvres datasets. The algorithm is validated on the clean ship model and the results present good fitness with the reference. Experiments in different sea states are conducted to investigate the effects of the turbulence on the identification performance. Generalisation results show that the models identified in the gentle and moderate environments have less than 10\% deviations and are considered allowable. The higher perturbations, the lower fidelity the identified model has. Models identified under disturbance could provide different levels of reliable support for the operation decision system.},

The empirical Bayesian method is used to clean simulated polluted responses from a 20°/20° zigzag test. Two efficient Bayesian models, conjugate regression and semi-conjugate regression, are adopted for hydrodynamic parameter identification. To obtain other prior parameters, the Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm is introduced in the Bayesian regression model. By using the identified model and an experimental model based on Blanke's nonlinear four-degrees-of-freedom (4-DOF) model, 10°/10° zigzag motion and 35° turning circle manoeuvring are performed. A comparison between the predicted results and the test results demonstrates that both Bayesian regression models have good generalization ability for identification, and that the conjugate Bayesian model has greater prediction accuracy.},

  abstract = {The design of maritime traffic simulators, model-based controllers, and maritime autonomous surface ships require accurate ship dynamic models. Using different nonparametric methods to identify a ship dynamic model using measurement data is a popular research topic. Among the proposed nonparametric models, the Gaussian process (GP) approach is a high-accuracy nonparametric modeling technique, and it can provide the uncertainty of the prediction. However, the high computational complexity of the GP restricts its further application, especially for online learning. Here, we present a novel online identification scheme, namely, the online fast noisy input Gaussian process (online-FNIGP) to identify ship response models. To avoid a high computational burden and the influence of noise, the fully independent training conditional (FITC) algorithm is introduced to the noisy input Gaussian process (NIGP), and it can significantly reduce the computational complexity. The developed scheme can incorporate new noisy measurements online and make fast predictions. The proposed method is verified by two examples: a simulation zigzag test with a parametric container ship and a random maneuver experiment with an unmanned surface vessel. For comparison with the proposed model, a regular Gaussian process is implemented to validate the developed approach. Both the simulation study results and the experimental study results indicate that the developed scheme is a powerful online identification tool for ship maneuvering systems. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

In the present study, the effect of oblique flow on propeller lateral loads is numerically investigated based on URANS method, coupled with SST k-ω turbulent model and sliding mesh method. An 82, 000 DWT bulk carrier with a single right-handed screw is computed. Both open water and behind-hull conditions are simulated for a range of drift angles from −20 to 20°. The lateral loads in open water increase with the drift angle increasing in a slightly non-linear trend. However, the behind-hull results are quite different from that in open water. At behind-hull conditions, the horizontal loads monotonously, non-linearly increase as the drift angle increases, while the vertical loads peak at the −5 deg drift angle (corresponding to the transverse flow coming from the portside). In large drift angles, the behind-hull lateral loads reach a larger percentage of the axial loads compared with the open-water results. Scale effect is also investigated by simulating the behind-hull flows with three scales. It is revealed that the increase in scales causes a slight decrease on the horizontal loads independently of drift angles, while it causes a remarkable increase and decrease on the vertical components for positive and negative drift angles, respectively.},

  abstract = {This paper explores a fast and efficient method for identifying and modeling ship maneuvering motion, and conducts a comprehensive experiment. Through the ship maneuvering test, the dynamics interaction between ship and the environment is obtained. Then, the LWL (Locally Weighted Learning algorithm) underlying architecture is constructed by sparse Gaussian Process to reduce the data requirements of LWL-based ship maneuvering motion modeling and to improve the performance for LWL. On this basis, a non-parametric model of ship maneuvering motion is established based on the locally weighted sparse Gaussian Process, and the traditional mathematical model of ship maneuvering motion is replaced by the generative model. This generative model considers the hydrodynamic effects of ships, and reduces the sensitivity of local weighted learning to sample data. In addition, matrix operations are transferred to the auxiliary platform to optimize the calculation performance of the method. Finally, the simulation results of ship maneuvering motion indicate that this method has the characteristics of efficiency, rapidity and universality, and its accuracy conforms to engineering practice.},

  abstract = {In this study, the crow search algorithm is used for the first time to address the parameter identification problem of the ship motion model in the autonomous navigation of ships. A target-oriented crow search algorithm (TO-CSA) is developed to use in this new search technique to identify model parameters, which greatly improves the speed of convergence, accuracy, and stability of the identification results. The main advantages of this approach over previous research are its improved computational accuracy and precise identification of ship parameters with fewer data or under specific sea conditions, which are in line with actual sailing scenarios. Additionally, the feasibility and efficiency of the created algorithm are evaluated by simulations and actual ship trials, and the engineering applicability of this research is shown based on the effectiveness of ship direction autopilot control.},

  abstract = {Azimuth-Stern-Drive tugs have relatively simple hull form, great propulsive performance and maneuverability, and these characteristics provide study advantages over cargo ships and other ship forms. At the pre-processing stage, ship maneuvering prediction based on CFD codes solving the RANSE are with successful applications. However, the work of obtaining the hydrodynamic derivatives and maneuvering coefficients needs to deal with water surface effects and propeller rotating motion, which is very time-consuming. Thereby, it is necessary to explore an appropriate CFD application strategy for ship maneuvering prediction, to balance the numerical accuracy and time costs. In this paper, a self-built low-speed ship motion control experimental platform, ’QiuXin V’, modified from a harbor tug, is studied. Double-body assumption combined with discretized propeller method is adopted to perform series of virtual captive model tests and self propulsion tests, to obtain the hydrodynamic derivatives, thruster performance, and maneuvering coefficients in straight moving conditions, while the flow attributes associated with the ducted thruster are predicted with empirical methods. Moreover, a modified steering force model is introduced to improve the maneuvering model accuracy. Non-disturbance turning and zigzag maneuvers are performed and compared with free-running model tests. Results show acceptable model accuracy and confirm the feasibility of the adopted integrated method in predicting the ASD ship maneuverability under low-speed conditions.},

  abstract = {Abstract   A nonparametric identification method based on    ν   (‘nu’)-support vector regression (   ν   -SVR) is proposed to establish robust models of ship maneuvering motion in an easy-to-operate way. Assisted by the kernel trick, the nonlinear model learns implicitly in high-dimensional feature space without a priori model structure. The    ν   -SVR controls the sparsity automatically, resulting in high efficiency. To improve the practicality, a parameter tuning scheme combining the hold-out validation and the simulation of dynamic processes is designed to avoid overfitting. Taking the KVLCC2 ship as the study object, the experimental data from the SIMMAN database are used to evaluate the method. The selection and pre-processing of training data are discussed. The identified model shows good generalization performance in the prediction of multiple maneuvers not involved in the training set, verifying the effectiveness of the method.},
