\noindent The repeatability of the experiments was studied in three repeated 20/20 zigzags to starboard (A--C) for the Optiwise test case as shown in \autoref{fig:repeatability}. There was a small time difference for the first counter-rudder action around t = 9 s that increased slightly during the later rudder actions around t = 34 s.
\autoref{fig:diff} shows differences between repeated tests expressed as deviations from the first test A. The largest difference in heading $\Psi$ is about 0.6 degrees, and the largest differences between total sway force $Y_D$ and yawing moment $N_D$ are about 5 N and 6 Nm.
