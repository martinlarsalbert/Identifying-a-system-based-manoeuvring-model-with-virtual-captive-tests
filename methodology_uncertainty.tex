\noindent The repeatability of the experiments was studied in three repeated 20/20 zigzags to starboard (A--C) for the Optiwise test case as shown in \autoref{fig:repeatability}. There was a small time difference for the first counter-rudder action around t = 9 s that increased slightly during the later rudder actions around t = 34 s.
\autoref{fig:diff} shows differences between repeated tests expressed as deviations from the first test A. 

There are small differences between the rudder angles
