\noindent As a complement to the inverse dynamics analysis, closed loop simulations were conducted for the wPCC. The simulation results are shown in \autoref{fig:sim_wPCC}. The results look quite similar to the inverse dynamic analysis presented above. The zigzag periods of the semi-empirical model were too short compared to the experiments and the overshoot angles were over-predicted up to three degrees. For the 10/10 zigzag test, by using the semi-empirical rudder to perform the close-loop maneuvering simulations, the over-prediction for both the first and second overshoot angles is about 1 degree. While for the 20/20 zigzag test, there is an increasing trend of over-prediction angles, i.e., less than 2 degrees over-prediction for the first overshoot angle, but up to 3 degrees discrepancy for the second overshoot angle. As explained before, this might be caused by the semi-empirical models to estimate rudder forces, as well as the asymmetric flow applied on the two rudders during the drifting operations.
