\noindent The identified hydrodynamic derivatives are listed in \autoref{sec:coefficients} in \autoref{tab:parameters}, where the hydrodynamic added mass terms are given in \autoref{tab:added_masses}. For the wPCC ship, the semi-empirical rudder model proposed by \cite{alexanderssonSystemIdentificationPhysicsinformed2024b} is used to obtain the rudder force. The parameters used in the semi-empirical model are listed in \autoref{tab:wPCC_other_parameters}. The validation of the proposed system identification method for the wPCC ship maneuvering is presented in detail as follows.
