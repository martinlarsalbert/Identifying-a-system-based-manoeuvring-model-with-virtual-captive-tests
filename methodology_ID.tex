\noindent Instead of using the equation of motion (\autoref{eq:eom}) to predict the acceleration $\pmb{\bm{\dot{\upsilon}}}$, this equation can instead be inverted to describe the inverse dynamics of the ship as:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:ID_X}
    \left.\begin{aligned}
    \input{equations/methodology_ID.X_D} \\
    \input{equations/methodology_ID.Y_D} \\
    \input{equations/methodology_ID.N_D}
    \end{aligned}\right\}
\end{equation}
% \begin{equation}
%     \label{eq:ID_Y}
%     \input{equations/methodology_ID.Y_D}
% \end{equation}
% \begin{equation}
%     \label{eq:ID_N}
%     \input{equations/methodology_ID.N_D}
% \end{equation}
It can be used to estimate the forces acting on the ship based on experimental data from the FRMTs. They can then be compared to the model force predictions. This is a more informative way to assess the model, than to compare its simulations with the FRMTs results.
